# Code Vision - Command line
Command line version of Code vision ,Project is based on [pycparser](https://github.com/eliben/pycparser). The program is based on two papers about source code plagiarism detection. The first one is [A Clustering Approach for Detecting Plagiarism in Source Code Data sets](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3e43/6af6f042c46cd43afa9341c7d7c45bdcb31f.pdf?_ga=1.200655531.400488828.1492426260)  and the second one is [A Hybrid Method forDetecting Source-code Plagiarism in Computer Programming Courses](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3e43/6af6f042c46cd43afa9341c7d7c45bdcb31f.pdf?_ga=1.200655531.400488828.1492426260). The program detects plagiarism in a corpus of source files and illustrates the result in a visible form using weighted graph clustering algorithm. The project is built on well known open source compilers and parsers such as pycparser which is used for research & experiment purposes,The project supports c and c++ .
